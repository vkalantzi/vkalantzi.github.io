				<h4> <font size="5"> Electronic structure calculations</font></h4>
				<p></p>
				<p align="justify"> Eigenvalue problems hold an important role in the study of 
				the electronic structure of many-body systems. Exploiting the Density 
				Functional Theory (DFT) framework, the solution 
				of the all-electron Schr $\ddot{o}$dinger equation is replaced by a
				one-electron Schr $\ddot{o}$dinger equation with an effective potential
				which leads to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem, known as the Kohn-Sham 
				equation:
				\begin{equation} \label{eq:kseq}
				- \left[\frac{\nabla^2}{2} + V_{ion}(r) + V_H(\rho(r), r) + V_{XC}(\rho(r), r)\right] \Psi_i(r) = E_i \Psi_i(r)
				\end{equation}
				where $\Psi_i(r)$ is a wave function and $E_i$ is a Kohn-Sham
				eigenvalue. The ionic potential $V_{ion}$ 
				reflects contributions from the core and depends on 
				the position $r$  only. Both the Hartree and the Exchange-Correlation potentials
				depend on the charge density: 
				\begin{equation}\label{eq:rho}
				\rho(r) = 2 \sum_{i=1}^{n_{occ}} |\Psi_i(r)|^2,
				\end{equation} 
				where $n_{occ}$ is  the number of occupied states  (for most systems of
				interest this is  half the number of valence electrons).
				Since the  total  potential $V_{total} = V_{ion}+V_H + V_{XC}$ 
				depends on  $\rho(r)$  which itself depends on  eigenfunctions  of the 
				Hamiltonian,  Equation (\ref{eq:kseq}) can be viewed 
				as  a nonlinear eigenvalue problem or a nonlinear eigenvector problem.
				The Hatree potential $V_H$  is obtained from 
				$\rho$ by solving the Poisson equation $ \nabla^2 V_H(r) = -4 \pi \rho(r)$
				with appropriate boundary conditions.  The Exchange-Correlation term $V_{XC}$ 
				is the key to the DFT approach and it captures the effects of reducing
				the problem from many particles to  a one-electron problem, i.e., 
				from replacing wavefunctions with many coordinates into ones that 
				depend solely on space location $r$.
				</p>
				
				<p align="justify"> Self-consistent  iterations  for  solving  the Kohn-Sham equation start with 
				an initial  guess  of the  charge  density  $\rho(r)$, from which a guess for 
				$V_{total}$  is computed. Then (\ref{eq:kseq}) is solved for   $\Psi_i(r)$'s  and a new $\rho(r)$ is obtained
				from (\ref{eq:rho}) and the potentials are updated.
				Then (\ref{eq:kseq}) is  solved again for a new $\rho$ obtained from 
				the new $\Psi_i(r)$'s,
				and  the  process is repeated   until  the total potential has
				converged. 

				A typical electronic structure calculation with many atoms requires 
				the calculation of  a large number of eigenvalues, specifically the
				$n_{occ}$ leftmost ones. In addition, calculations based on
				Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory,
				require  a substantial
				number of unoccupied states, states beyond the Fermi level, in addition
				to the occupied ones. 
				Thus, it is not uncommon to see eigenvalue problems
				in the size of  millions  where (tens) of thousands of eigenvalues may be
 				needed. </p>

				<p> One can also "attack" the problem without using pseudopotentials, i.e., using an all-electron (full potential)
				approach where the effect of core electrons is explicitly included in the model. </p>

				<h4> <font size="5"> Finite element modal and frequency response analysis</font> </h4>
				<p></p>
				<p align="justify"> Engineering structures have a set of natural frequencies (the frequency at which a 
				structure tends to oscillate in the absence of any external force). If a structure is excited by an 
				external force whose frequency is close to a natural frequency, the structure starts oscillating
				and the amplitude of the vibration increases manyfold (i.e., resonance takes place). Frequency response 
				analysis describes how a structure responds to a prescribe load over a range of frequencies, and allows
				to determine its resonance behavior. Ideally, forced and natural frequencies should not be close 
				(<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/11/051103080801.htm" target="_blank">see here for an example
				of resonance</a>).</p>

				<p align="justify">
				Assuming a closed domain without damping, the frequency response function is
				often modeled as the solution of the following linear system:
				\begin{equation}
				K-\omega^2 M = f, \label{modan}
				\end{equation}
				where $K$ and $M$ are symmetric matrices known as the stiffness and mass matrix, respectively.
				The right-hand side $f$ represents the force applied to the structure. Variable
				$\omega$ represents the frequency of interest, and, typically, takes values within a
				frequency band $\Omega=[\omega_l,\omega_u]$. The standard approach of solving  
				equation (\ref{modan}) for all different frequency instances becomes
				computationally intractable for modern Finite Element models since the size of the stiffness and
				mass matrices can easily be in the order of millions.
				An alternative is to project equation (\ref{modan}) on a low-dimensional subspace, drastically
				reducing the dimension of the problem,
				and compute the frequency response of the projected structure for as many frequency instances as
				necessary, instead. The most commonly used choice is to form the aforementioned 
				low-dimensional subspace by the eigenvectors of the matrix pancil $(K,M)$ which correspond to
				eigenvalues which magnitude is located within a certain region on the real axis. The latter
				leads to the necessity to partially solve an eigenvalue problem of the form $Kx=\lambda M x$.
				Matrix $M$ is positive-definite, while the accuracy sought for the eigenpairs is of the order
				of the discretization error of the FE model.
